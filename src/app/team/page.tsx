      "At Good & Plenty Wellness, therapy isn`t one size fits all it`s dynamic, engaging, and tailored to your unique needs. Whether in a traditional talk therapy session, engaging in breathwork, or walking outdoors, my goal is to help you cultivate resilience, self-compassion, and a sense of balance in your life. With specialties in anxiety, depression, trauma, relational issues, self-esteem, communication, and perinatal mental health, I offer a compassionate and down-to-earth space for healing. I am committed to guiding you toward growth, connection, and a more fulfilling life.",
      "  Outside of therapy, you can find me doing Pilates, spending time outdoors, lost in a good book, or enjoying quality time with my husband and two little ones. I believe healing should be as much about joy, movement, and self-discovery as it is about working through the tough stuff. Let`s connect and get you moving toward the life you want!",
